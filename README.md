## My Solutions to Project Euler in Ruby using TDD

I haven't done [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) or TDD at any point in the past.  Both are new to me when starting this so I will see where it takes me.  This repo is just a place I am keeping track of my work on these problems. 

I am not attempting to solve the problems in the shortest most concise manner, the main goal is to teach myself TDD while doing something fun and challenging.

My solutions to the problems I do will be in lib/ while the tests can be found in spec/.
