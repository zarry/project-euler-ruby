# My solutions to Project Euler in Ruby using TDD

I haven't done [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) or TDD at any point in the past.  Both are new to me when starting this so I will see where it takes me.  This repo is just a place I am keeping track of my work on these problems. 

My solutions to the problems I do will be in lib/ while the tests can be found in spec/.
